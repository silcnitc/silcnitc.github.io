                        The ExpL compiler needs to translate a given source program and generate the <b>target machine code</b> into an <b>executable file</b> in a format which is recognized by the load module of the target operating system. Thus, in order to generater the executable, the following information needs to be made available to the compiler :
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The <b>machine instruction set</b> of the target machine.</li>
                        <li>The (virtual) <b>address space</b> model available for the target program. Conventionally, this address space is logically divided into regions like <b>code, data, stack, heap</b> etc.</li>
                        <li>The format for the target file (<b>executable format</b>). The compiler typically passes information regarding the sizes and address regions allocated to the code, data, stack, text and heap regions to the loader by setting appropriate values in the <b>header</b> of the executable file.</li>
                        <li>Interfaces for OS routines that needs to be invoked to get certain operations like input/output done. This is specified in <a href="#nav-eXpOS-system-library-interface">the library interface</a> documentation.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These specifications depend not only on the target machine architecture, but also on the operating system upon which the target machine code must execute. Typically these specifications are collected together in the OS specification into a document called the Application Binary Interface (ABI).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following sections specify the ABI for the <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/">eXpOS operating system</a> run on the <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/support_tools-files/xsm-simulator.html">XSM virtual machine model</a>. The executable format is called the XEXE executable format.

Registers available are R0-R19, SP, BP and IP.

                    <h2>The virtual address space model</h2>
                    <p>
                        The (virtual) address space of any eXpOS process is logically divided into four parts namely Library, Heap, Code and Stack.
                    </p>
                    <center><img src="img/memory_model_1.png" alt="" style="margin-left:-20%;"/></center>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Library</b> contains routines for implementing dynamic memory allocation functions Alloc(), Free() and Initialize().  The compiler must generate code to invoke the library with appropriate function identifiers to call these functions.  The library also provides routines that trap into the OS for performing Read() and Write() operatins.  The library code, once created, can be used by any application for the above functions.  The ABI stipulates that the library code must be loaded between address 0 and 1023 of the virtual address space.  Note that since each XSM instruction takes up two memory words, the library can be of size at most 512 instructions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Heap</b> is the portion of the address space of a process reserved as the memory pool from which dynamic memory allocation is done by the allocator routines in the library.   The memory region between address 1024 and 2047 is reserved for the heap.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Code</b> contains the header and code part of the <a href="#nav-XEXE-executable-file-format">XEXE executable file</a>, which is loaded by the eXpOS loader from the file system when the Exec system call is executed. The first eight words of the executable file contains the header. The rest of the code region contains the XSM instructions. The total size of code section cannot exceed X_CSIZE. The eXpOS implementation for the XSM architecture discussed here sets X_CSIZE to 1024 words. Hence, the code region will be between memory addressess 2048 and 3071 in the address space of the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Stack</b> is the space reserved for the runtime stack of the process. Parameters and local variables associated with functions in a program are allocated in the stack. In the XSM architecture, the stack grows upwards and the maximum stack size is X_SSIZE. Global variables must be allocated in the stack as the executable file format does not support a separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment">Data region</a>. The eXpOS implementation for the XSM architecture discussed here sets X_SIZE to 1024 words.Thus the stack will occupy the region betweem memory address 3072 and 4095 in the address space of the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A description of the user level address space provided by XSM is given here.

                    <h2>The library interface</h2>
                    <p>
                        ExpL file operations and Input/Ouput operations must be mapped to the corresponding system calls of the underlying operating system. The eXpOS library comes with a set of built-in functions that provide a generic interface for invoking the OS sytem calls. The library also provides a set of functions for  heap management (dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation). Thus the ExpL compiler can simply generate code to invoke these library routines to translate the corresponding high level operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A specification of the eXpOS library interface is given below:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eXpOS library consists of a collection of user level routines provided as part of the operating system. These routines are loaded to the memory during OS start up and can be linked to the address space of any user process by the OS loader (exec system call). The OS loader will link these routines to the shared library region of the address space if the library flag in the header of the executable file being loaded is set to 1. The library provides a <b>uniform system call interface</b> through which application program can invoke system calls by providing the system call number and the arguments. The interface hides the details of the interrupt service routine corresponding to the system call from the application program, thereby making it architecture independent. The library also provides user level routines for <b>dynamic memory management (allocation and de-allocation)</b> from the <i>heap region</i> of the application.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Unified System Call Interface</h4>
                    <p>
                        This library routine is linked to virtual address 0 of the address space of a process by the OS loader and requires four arguments (system call number and three arguments to the system call) to be passed through the stack. The routine invokes the corresponding low level system call and returns to the user program the return value of the system call through the stack. The following figure shows the contents of the stack immediately after a call to this library routine.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/system_call_interface_stack.png" alt="" />
                    <h4>Dynamic Memory Management Module Interface</h4>
                    <p>
                        The dynamic memory management module interface takes two inputs - a function code (0 for alloc and 1 for free - see high level library interface -- Put Link for specification) and one argument passed through the stack. The retrun value is passed back to the application through the stack. The OS loader of the present version of eXpOS for XSM architecture links this routine to virtual address 512 of the application process. The following figure shows the contents of the stack just before a call to this library routine.

                    <h2>XEXE executable file format</h2>
                    <p>
                        The compiler must generate target code into a file in the format specified below so that the eXpOS loader recognizes the format and load the program into memory for execution correctly.   Each executable file contains a header in which the compiler adds information like the initial value to be given to the stack pointer in the virtual addres space, initial value of the instruction pointer etc, the starting (virtual) addresses and sizes of various memory regions like text, stack, heap etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Executable files in eXpOS must be in the XEXE format as eXpOS executes only files of such format.An XEXE executable file in eXpOS consists of two parts:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Header</li>
                        <li>Code</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="img/exe_file.jpeg" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        The maximum size of the file (including the header) is limited by the constant EXE_SIZE. The eXpOS implementation for the XSM architecture discussed here sets EXE_SIZE to 1024 words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first eight words of an executable file are reserved for the header which describes the features of file. The structure of the header is :
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/header.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        <b>XMAGIC</b> is a number indicating the type of executable file. All XEXE files will have magic number 0. For more on Magic Number, click here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Entry point</b> contains the virtual address in memory of the first instruction to be executed (entry point) of the program after the OS loader has loaded it. During loading, the program counter must be initialized to this address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Text Size, Data Size, Heap Size</b> and <b>Stack size</b> indicates the sizes of Text, Data, Heap and Stack regions to be allocated by the OS loader when the file is loaded for execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note : The present eXpOS virtual address space model requires that the data and stack must be in the same memory area and must be managed by the compiler / application program. The value of Data Size field is ignored. Moreover, the size allocated for text and stack regions in memory are set to 1024 irrespective of the values present in the header.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the <b>Runtime Library</b> must be included when the file is loaded, the Library Flag is set to 1 in the executable file. If this flag is not set then neither memory is allocated for the heap nor the library linked to the address space of the process at execution time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, the eXpOS loader maps an executable file into its virtual address according to the following table :
