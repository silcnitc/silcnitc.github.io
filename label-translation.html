                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Labels are generated when the compiler translates the high level program constructs such as <i>if-then-else</i>, <i>while-do</i> and <i>function calls</i>
                         into target machine code. Labels are needed because the target address of a JUMP instruction may not be known
                         at the time of generating code (Why?). However these labels must be replaced with target addresses in the final target code.
                         Thus the compiler designer needs to write a program to replace all the labels in the program with the correct memory
                         addresses eventually. This conversion is called Label translation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>input to the label translator program is the machine code with labels</b> (generated by <a href="codegen.html"> codeGen()</a>). The <b>output is the target machine code with the labels replaced with corresponding addresses</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main idea behind label translation is to execute the following two steps.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li id="otis">1. The input ( machine code with labels ) is parsed and a table in which the labels are mapped with
                               their corresponding addresses is created.</li>

                            <li id="otis">2. Parse the input again and replace all the labels with their corresponding addresses by
                              looking into the table created above.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><span style="color: red;">*</span>Note:</b> In real systems, the compiler generates an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file" target="_blank"> object file</a> which contains
                        labels for functions as well as variables.  The object file is processed by a separate software module called the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)" target="_blank">linker</a> which converts the object file
                        into an excutable file.  The advantage of this scheme is that a huge program could be divided into different stand alone
                        source modules, each compiled seperately
                        and finally linked together. A change in one module does not require recompilation of other modules and only the
                         linking phase needs to be run again. In this project, we keep the linking task as a part of the compilation itself as
                         ExpL does not allow a program to be compiled into several object modules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the ExpL project, variable addresses are resolved before reaching the Label translation phase by the compiler itself.
                        Hence the labels remaining will correspond to
                        <br>
                        a) The label of the first instruction to be executed (MAIN:),
                         <br>
                         b) Labels placed at the beginning of assembly instructions to which
                        there is some JMP/JZ/JNZ from somewhere.
                         <br>
                         c) Labels placed at the beginning of functions. (The compiler
                        translates a call to the function with a CALL instruction with this label).

                            In the machine code generated after codegen section, labels occur in two different ways.<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. Label declarations in which labels are followed by semicolon (:).</li>
                                <li id="otis"><b>Examples</b> : F0: is a label for the instruction at address 2066, L0: for 2102, L1: for 2162 and MAIN: for 2186 as in <a href="#fig1">figure1</a></li>.
                                <li id="otis">2. Instructions which contain labels in them namely, JMP, JZ, JNZ and CALL.</li>
                                <li id="otis"><b>Examples</b> : JMP L1 at address 2100, JZ R0,L3 at address 2248, CALL MAIN at address 2062 etc., as in <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, the label translation procedure can be explained with the help of an example label F0 from the <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>.<br>
                            <br>
                            First <b>"F0:"</b> needs to be recognized as a label and the memory address of the label occurence need to be stored in a table called the <b>Label-Address Table</b>.  In the above example, the address corresponding to <b>F0:</b> is 2066.
                            We need to parse the entire machine code to identify all the labels in the program and store all the (label, address) pairs in the Label-Address table.
                          </p>
                            <p>
                             In this pass, we remove the label F0: as well as other labels from the program. The next task is to replace labels occuring in instructions with the addresses of the labels from the label-address table.  Refering to the <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>, there are two instructions that use the label F0: <b> CALL F0 occuring at address 2136 </b> and <b>CALL F0 occuring at address 2302</b>. We will replace the labels in these instructions with the address of F0 (2066) by looking up the label-address table.  Thus, after translation, both these instructions will translate to <b>CALL 2066</b> as shown in <a href="#fig2">figure2</a>.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The label translator program needs to parse the entire machine code two times. In the first parse we identify all the label declarations and the memory addresses in the label-address table.
                            The table constructed after the first parse of the above code is shown below.
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/label-table.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the second parse, we remove the label declarations and replace the labels in instructions like JUMP, CALL etc. with the corresponding memory address from the label-address table.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The target code after the label translation is shown in the <a href="#fig2"> figure 2</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Implementing Label Translation</h3>

                          <!--  The above two pass translation process can be implemented using a single Lex program.The following functions provided by Lex can be useful while implementing the parser :
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. <b>yyless(k)</b> : Returns all but the first n characters of the current token back to the input stream, where they will be rescanned when the scanner looks for the next match. <b>yytext</b> and <b>yyleng</b> are adjusted appropriately (e.g., yyleng will now be equal to n ).<br>
                                For example, on the input "foobar" the following will write out "foobarbar":<br>
                                <div class="syntax">
                                    %%<br>
                                    foobar    ECHO; yyless(3);<br>
                                    [a-z]+    ECHO;<br>
                                </div>
                                An argument of 0 to yyless will cause the entire current input string to be scanned again. Unless you've changed how the scanner will subsequently process its input, this will result in an endless loop. Note that yyless is a macro and can only be used in the flex input file, not from other source files.</li>
                                <li id="otis">2. <b>yytext+k</b> : ignores the first k characters in yytext.</li>
                            </ul>
                          -->
                          <p>
                          As noted previously, the input to the label translator program is the machine code with labels (generated by <a href="codegen.html"> codeGen()</a>). The output is the target machine code with the labels replaced with corresponding addresses.

                          It is easy to design a simple lex program which does two passes on the input file
                          and perform label translation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The first pass must collect all the label declarations and simultaneously keep track of the addresses of the
                          instructions corresponding to the label.  Since the pattern "<i>letter.(letter|digit)*:</i>"
                          identifies a label, it is easy to design a LEX rule to recognize all label declarations in the program.
                          The compiler must ensure that label names are different from instructions, to avoid confusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Since each XSM instruction takes two words of storage, and the first instruction is at address 2056,
                          the first pass can track the address corresponding to each label declaration
                          as 2056 + 2 *(InstructionNumber-1).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The program can maintain a simple linked list into
                          which each label address pair found is entered.  The label declarations can be
                          removed from the input program, once it's table entry is made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the second pass, the program must "search and replace" each label occuring in the
                          control transfer instructions (JMP, JZ, JNZ and CALL)
                          with the corresponding address in the label table.  Since the instruction set is fixed and labels
                          are lexically different from instructions, a simple set of LEX rules can identify all labels
                          and perform the replacement.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          We leave the implementation details to you.
                        </p>

                          <b>Question</b> :<br>
                          What is the difficulty in implementing the label translation using single pass algorithm?
                        </p>
