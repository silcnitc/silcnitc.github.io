                    <p>
                        Labels are generated while translating the high level program constructs such as if-then-else, while-do and function calls into target machine code as an intermediate step in code generation. Labels are needed because the target address of a JUMP instruction may not be known at the time of generating code. However these labels must be replaced with target addresses in the final target code. Thus the compiler designer needs to write a program to replace all the labels in the program with the correct memory addresses eventually. This conversion is called Label translation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The input to the label translator program is the machine code with labels (generated by <a href="codegen.html"> codeGen()</a>). The output is the target machine code without the labels (replaced with corresponding addresses).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main idea behind label translation is to execute the following two steps.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li id="otis">1. The input ( machine code with labels ) is parsed and a table in which the labels are mapped with their corresponding addresses is created.</li>

                            <li id="otis">2. Parse the input again and replace all the labels with their corresponding addresses by looking into the table created above.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><span style="color: red;">*</span>Note:</b> In real systems, the compiler generates an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file" target="_blank"> object file</a> which contains labels for functions as well as variables.  The object file is processed by a separate software module called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)" target="_blank">linker</a> which converts the object file into an excutable file.  The advantage of this scheme is that a huge program could be divided into different stand alone source modules, each compiled seperately and finally linked together. A change in one module does not require recompilation of other modules and only the linking phase needs to be run again. In this project, we keep the linking task as a part of the compilation itself as ExpL does not allow a program to be compiled into several object modules. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the ExpL project, variable addresses are resolved before reaching the Label translation phase and only symbolic references to functions are left to be replaced with addresses in this phase.

                            In the machine code generated after codegen section, labels occur in two different ways.<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. Label declarations in which labels are followed by semicolon (:).</li>
                                <li id="otis"><b>Examples</b> : F0: is a label for the instruction at address 2066, L0: for 2102, L1: for 2162 and MAIN: for 2186 as in <a href="#fig1">figure1</a></li>.
                                <li id="otis">2. Instructions which contain labels in them are JMP, JZ, JNZ and CALL.</li>
                                <li id="otis"><b>Examples</b> : JMP L1 at address 2100, JZ R0,L3 at address 2248, CALL MAIN at address 2062 etc., as in <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, we will understand the label translation procedure with the help of an example label F0 from the <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>.<br>
                            First <b>F0:</b> need to be recognized and the memory address of the label occurance need to be stored in a table called Label-Address Table.  In this case, the address corresponding to <b>F0:</b> is 2066. We need to parse the entire machine code to identify all labels and store all (label, address) pairs in the Label-Address table. In this pass, we remove the label F0: as well as other labels from the program. The next task is to replace labels occuring in instructions with the addresses of the labels from the label-address table.  Refering to the <a href="#fig1">figure1</a>, there are two instructions that use the label F0: <b> CALL F0 occuring at address 2136 </b> and <b>CALL F0 occuring at address 2302</b>. We will replace the labels in these instructions with the address of F0 (2066) by looking up the label-address table.  Thus, after translation, both these instructions will translate to <b>CALL 2066</b> as shown in <a href="#fig2">figure2</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The label translater program need to parse the entire machine code two times. In the first parse we identify all the label declarations and the memory addresses in the label-address table.   The table constructed after the first parse of the above code is shown below.
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/label-table.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the second parse, we remove the label declarations and replace the labels in instructions like JUMP, CALL etc. with the corresponding memory address from the label-address table.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The target code after the label translation is shown in the <a href="#fig2"> figure 2</a>.
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Implementing Label Translation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The above two pass translation process can be implemented using a single Lex program.The following functions provided by Lex can be useful while implementing the parser :
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. <b>yyless(k)</b> : Returns all but the first n characters of the current token back to the input stream, where they will be rescanned when the scanner looks for the next match. <b>yytext</b> and <b>yyleng</b> are adjusted appropriately (e.g., yyleng will now be equal to n ).<br>
                                For example, on the input "foobar" the following will write out "foobarbar":<br>
                                <div class="syntax">                                    
                                    %%<br>
                                    foobar    ECHO; yyless(3);<br>
                                    [a-z]+    ECHO;<br>
                                </div>
                                An argument of 0 to yyless will cause the entire current input string to be scanned again. Unless you've changed how the scanner will subsequently process its input, this will result in an endless loop. Note that yyless is a macro and can only be used in the flex input file, not from other source files.</li>
                                <li id="otis">2. <b>yytext+k</b> : ignores the first k characters in yytext.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
