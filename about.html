          <!--
            <p>
            This project aims to develop an online self-sufficient educational platform to help undergraduate Computer Science students understand the functioning of a compiler for a simple procedural language by writing a small toy compiler themselves.  (An object oriented extension for the language has been added subsequently.) The project will provide students with a <a href="roadmap.html" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for the development process and guide them along the roadmap with supporting documentation. Using the step-by-step guidance offered by the roadmap, the students will be able to build the compiler under minimal expert supervision.
         </p>
         <p>
           The platform is designed assuming that the student has a basic knowledge of Data structures, Computer organization and a working proficiency of the C programming language. Being instructional in nature, this project tries to give some insight into the working of LEX, YACC and the usage of these tools to develop a compiler for an instructional language custom designed for the project - called ExpL (Experimental language).   Brief theoretical explanations are provided on a <i>need-to-do</i> basis.
         </p>
          <p>
           The project is designed to be done concurrently with a theory course in Compiler Design, typically offered during the third year of an undergraduate CS curriculum.   It is by no means a replacement to the theory course, but is only designed to supplement it.    The project will help in solidifying the student's grasp of compiler design theory - about how the components of a compiler can be assembled together to form the whole.  The student will also experience the end-to-end process of translation from a source high level language to a target executable.
         </p>
         <p>
           The roadmap first guides the student to build a simple expression compiler.  Static variables are then introduced to this expression compiler and control flow constructs are added next.  Till this phase, only integer type is allowed.  In the next step, support for string type is added to the language and type checking issues are discussed.  Support for arrays are added next.   Subroutines and run time allocation comes next and finally support for user defined types and dynamic memory allocation is added.  (A final phase of providing support for classes and subtype polymorphism has been added subsequently).  The road-map is designed in such a way that as far as practicable, only one new concept is introduced at a time.
         </p>
         <p>
           Starting right from the first phase, the student has to generate code that can be loaded and executed by a simulator provided along with the platform.  The simulator is designed to load and run executable files satisfying a specified <a href="abi.html" target="_blank"> application binary interface specification(ABI)</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
           It is our responsibility to explicitly state some central concepts that the project fails to teach.  Here are some among the key omissions:
           <ul>
             <li id="otis">
               1.  The machine architecture, virtual memory model (and the target ABI in general) are unrealistically simple and custom made.  Consequently it is easy to generate code for the target platform, but the platform is far from any real system.  To illustrate the level of oversimplification,  a memory word of the target machine is assumed to be capable of storing an arbitrary integer or a string.  Floating point handling is omitted.  The executable file format is extremely simple to understand, but too restrictive for real use.  (There has been simplifications in the source language specification as well.  But those are less dramatic.)<br><br>
             </li>
             <li id = "otis">
               2.  To avoid trouble with binary formatting, the executable file is allowed to contain mnemonic instructions rather than binary.  Students are still required to resolve symbolic references to actual logical addresses and only the replacement of symbolic instructions with actual binary instructions is avoided.<br><br>
             </li>
             <li id="otis">
               3.  Code, register or memory optimizations are not attempted as these topics are beyond the scope of the project. The focus here is to get working target code generated.  The roadmap asks the students to directly traverse an intermediate abstract syntax tree representation of the program and directly generate assembly language code.  This is followed by a label translation pass to resolve labels in the target code.<br><br>
             </li>
             <li id="otis">
               4.   Focus has not been placed on efficient data structuring or following software engineering practices.  The road-map suggests an implementation that can be built incrementally and is simple to comprehend.
             </li>
           </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
           In short, the project is designed to help the student to gain knowledge, appreciation and insight into the working of compilers, but does not try to train the student in professional compiler writing.  This particular pedagogical choice has been taken to spare the student from the technicalities of machine architecture, executable/object formats and the complexities of the ABI of real systems – something that in our experience seems to drive a lot of students away from systems projects.  Our hope is that once the basic material is assimilated, the student will be more confident to get involved with these details in professional life.

       <ol>

         Any pedagogical compiler implementation project offered as part of an undergraduate junior level
compiler design course needs to satisfy two fundamental requirements:

<br>

     <li>
       <br>
      1. The student must be given as much depth and detail as possible about the central concepts. That
is, the project must be sufficiently non-trivial to be instructive.
     </li>

     <br>
     <li>
      2. The quantity of work involved must not exceed what a student is able to complete in about four
       months, taking also into consideration the fact that she/he would be crediting several other courses
       concurrently. Thus, the project must be sufficiently simple to be do-able.
     </li>

      </ol>
      <br>

      <p>

        The problem before the teacher is to decide on how much compromise on (1) must be done in favour of
(2). The present project is our stance in this matter. We expain our choices here.

      </p>

      <p>

        There are two aspects associated with the design and implementation of each major functional unit of a
compiler. – 1) A <i>Policy</i> and 2) An implementation <i>Mechanism</i>. As an illustration, consider dynamic
memory allocation. Fixed size allocation is a policy. The most common implementation mechanism is
to have a run time library that manages allocation from the the heap. As another example, consider
passing of parameters to functions. Call by value/call by reference are a policies. Passing
values/addresses through a run time stack is the standard implementation mechanism. Yet another
example, a language may describe a dynamic method binding policy for supporting subtype
polymorphism in single inheritence hierarchy. Virtual function table mechanism is the most common
way to implement the policy. Of course, each of the above policies and mechanisms need more detailed
and concrete specification. Detailed descriptions of the policies and mechanisms associated with various
functions of a compiler are given in the project documentation.

      </p>

      <p>

        The pedagogical strategy is to specify a programming language that has a <i>very simple policy</i> associated
with functional unit of the compiler. This allows the student to implement the policy easily, once the
implementation mechanism is understood. For instance, fixed-size allocation policy is specified for
dynamic memory allocation. We provide detailed tutorials for various implementation mechanisms
necessary to implement the policies associated with each such functional unit of the compiler. This helps
the student to learn the implementation mechanisms quickly. Once the student completes the
implementation one simple policy that uses a particular mechanism, she will be in a position to visualize
the implementation of more sophisticated policies associated with a particular functionality that use
similar mechanisms without actually going through an implementation project.

      </p>

      <p>

        The project is designed to be done concurrently with a theory course in Compiler Design, typically
offered during the third year of an undergraduate CS curriculum. It by no means is a replacement to the
theory course, but is only designed to suppliment it. The project will help in solidifying the student's
grasp of compiler design theory - about how the components of a compiler can be assembled together to
form the whole. The student will experience the end-to-end process of translation from a high level
language source to a target executable. The road-map is designed in such a way that as far as practicable,
only one new concept is introduced at a time.

          It is our responsiblity to explicitly state some central concepts that the project fails to teach. Here are
some key omissions:

<br>

      <li>
        <br>
      1.  The machine architecture, virtual memory model (and the the target ABI in general) are unrealisitically
simple and custom made. Consequently it is easy to generate code for the target platfform, but the
platform is far from any real system. To illustrate the level of oversimplification, a memory word of the
target machine is assumed to be capable of storing an arbitrary interger or a string. Floating point
handling is ommitted. The executable file format is extremely simple to understand, but too restrictive for
real use. (There are simplifications in the source language specification as well, but those are less
dramatic.)
      </li>
<br>
      <li>

      2.  The project is front-end intensive, but has a thin back-end. Code, register or memory optimizations are
  not attempted. The focus here is to get working target code generated as easily as possible. The roadmap
  asks the students to directly traverse an intermediete abstract syntax tree representation of the program

  and generate assembly language code. This is followed by a linking phase to resolve labels in the target
  code. Improving the back-end code generation process would require data flow analysis (at least
  liveliness analysis) which is better done with the support of tools like LLVM. Going into these
  directions would make the project too heavy for one semester. Typically, a second course in compiler
  design takes up these topics anyway.


      </li>

      <br>

      <li>

        3. Focus has not been placed on efficient data structuring or following software engineering practices
  religiously. The road-map suggests a simple implementation that can be built incrementally.

          This project is the second one in a suite of two student learning projects designed to tutor undergraduate
CS juniors. The first one in the suite is an OS development project (<a href="http://exposnitc.github.io" target="_blank">exposnitc.github.io</a>), which asks the
student to implement a simple multi-tasking operating system on the same machine architecture used in
the present project. The target code of the compiler implemented in the present project is designed to be
executable by the OS implemented in the first project. Our hope is that by going through the projects, the
student will gain a clear conceptual understanding of how the two central software systems – the OS and
the compiler - work together in a computer system.
